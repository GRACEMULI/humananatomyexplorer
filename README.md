# 3D Human Anatomy Explorer

## Overview

The 3D Human Anatomy Explorer is an interactive educational application that allows users to explore the human anatomy in 3D. The application is built using WebGL for 3D rendering and Python (Flask) for server-side logic. Users can navigate through different body systems, interact with 3D organs, and learn about their functions. Additionally, clicking on a specific organ provides users with relevant facts and information.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Exploration:** Navigate through different body systems, including the skeletal, muscular, circulatory, and nervous systems, using a user-friendly 3D interface.
  
- **Organ Information:** Click on specific organs to view detailed information, facts, and functions. 

- **WebGL and Three.js:** Utilizes WebGL and the Three.js library for creating immersive 3D graphics in the browser.

- **Python (Flask) Server:** The server-side logic is handled by Flask, a Python web framework, for routing and serving content.
